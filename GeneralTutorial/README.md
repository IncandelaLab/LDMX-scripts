# Links to the main documentation for getting started
Generarly read through https://ldmx-software.github.io/

If you are not going to touch any of the .cpp files in ldmx-sw, you can use `denv` and have the software as an container image only
https://ldmx-software.github.io/using/getting-started.html#install-denv
Look up the possible tags here
https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw/tags

If you will change the .cpp files, use `just` as explained here
https://ldmx-software.github.io/developing/getting-started.html#install-just

# Running on ROOT files containing events

There is two way to do this:
1) The traditional way of looping through events and objects.

An example config can be found here [runEventLoop](https://github.com/IncandelaLab/LDMX-scripts/blob/master/GeneralTutorial/runEventLoop.py)
Run it with the following (in case of not needing to change ldmx-sw)
```
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
denv init ldmx/pro:v4.1.0
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncandelaLab/LDMX-scripts/master/GeneralTutorial/runEventLoop.py
denv python3 runEventLoop.py  
```
2) Putting objects into data frames and have vectorized oparations.

This is faster but can be harder to conceptualize. 
We have several examples in this repo, but also look at
https://ldmx-software.github.io/using/analysis/python.html

3) Using ldmx-sw events and c++

In https://github.com/IncandelaLab/LDMX-scripts/blob/master/EnergyResStudies/myAna_cfg.py we run a custom analyzer written in c++, 
can be found here https://github.com/IncandelaLab/LDMX-scripts/blob/master/EnergyResStudies/MyAna.cxx
This then uses the c++ object in the ROOT file and makes histograms using the DQM functonality.
