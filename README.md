# LDMX-scripts

Scripts designed to run an ECal veto analysis on LDMX simulation event files. The `EcalVeto` directory has scripts to run over v9 samples (produced with an older geometry and framework), while the `EcalVeto-2.0` directory contains scripts and instructions to run over newer, v12, samples. Please look at the READMEs in the appropriate directory for instructions on how to get started.
